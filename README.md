## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cim-keys = { path = "../cim-keys" }
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use cim_keys::{
    KeyManager, Signer, CertificateManager,
    KeyAlgorithm, KeyUsage, SignatureFormat,
    ssh::SshKeyManager,
    tls::TlsManager,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Generate an SSH key
    let ssh_manager = SshKeyManager::new();
    let key_id = ssh_manager.generate_key(
        KeyAlgorithm::Ed25519,
        "user@example.com".to_string(),
        KeyUsage::Signing,
    ).await?;

    // Sign data
    let signature = ssh_manager.sign(
        &key_id,
        b"Hello, World!",
        SignatureFormat::Raw,
    ).await?;

    // Generate a TLS certificate
    let tls_manager = TlsManager::new();
    let (key_id, cert_id) = tls_manager.generate_self_signed(
        "example.com",
        vec!["example.com".to_string()],
        KeyAlgorithm::Ecdsa(EcdsaCurve::P256),
        365,
    ).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

- 20-year validity, proper CA constraints
- Automatic node creation in PKI graph view
- Non-blocking async operations

**👤 Personal Keys Generation**
- Same secure passphrase dialog
- X.509 certificate generation for personal use
- NATS identity keys (Operator, Account, User)
- 1-year validity for personal certificates
- Graph visualization of all generated keys

**🔑 Passphrase Dialog Features**
- Confirmation field to prevent typos
- Real-time strength indicator (visual bar + color)

- Visibility toggle
- Secure memory zeroization after use
- Minimum 12 character validation

### Building the GUI

```bash
# Enter Nix development shell (provides all dependencies)
nix develop

# Build native GUI application
cargo build --release --features gui

# Run the GUI
cargo run --bin cim-keys-gui --release -- /path/to/output/dir
```

### Using the GUI

#### 1. Import from Secrets (Recommended)

The GUI can import your complete organizational configuration from JSON files:

**Required files:**
- `secrets/secrets.json` - Organization and people configuration with master passphrase
- `secrets/cowboyai.json` - YubiKey configurations and roles

**What gets imported:**
- ✅ Organization name and domain
- ✅ Master passphrase for encryption
- ✅ All people with roles and email addresses
- ✅ YubiKey configurations (serials, PINs, PUKs, management keys)
- ✅ Role assignments (Root CA, Backup, User, Service)

Click **"Import from Secrets"** on the Welcome screen to load everything automatically.

#### 2. Manual Configuration

Alternatively, create your domain manually:

1. **Welcome Tab** - Create new domain or load existing
2. **Organization Tab**
   - Set organization name and domain
   - Create master passphrase
   - Add people to organization graph
   - Define relationships (reports to, delegates to, trusts)
   - Drag nodes to arrange graph layout
3. **Locations Tab**
   - Add physical/logical locations for key storage
   - Set security levels (FIPS 140 Level 1-4, Commercial, Basic)
   - Location types: Data Center, Office, Cloud Region, Safe Deposit, etc.
4. **Keys Tab**
   - Detect YubiKeys (shows all connected devices)
   - Generate Root CA
   - Generate Intermediate CAs
   - Generate Server Certificates
   - Provision YubiKeys with keys
   - View all imported YubiKey configurations
   - View generated certificates and keys from manifest
5. **Export Tab**
   - Export to encrypted SD card
   - Generate manifest with all configuration

#### 3. Data Persistence

All data is automatically saved to `manifest.json` in your output directory:

**On startup, the GUI loads:**
- ✅ Organization information
- ✅ All saved locations
- ✅ All people entries
- ✅ All generated certificates (with validity dates, issuers)
- ✅ All generated keys (with hardware backing status)

**The manifest persists:**
- Organization metadata
- Location database
- People registry
- Certificate inventory with PKI details
- Key inventory with YubiKey associations
- Complete event log for audit trail

#### 4. YubiKey Operations

**Detection:**
```bash
# Click "Detect YubiKeys" in Keys tab
# Shows: Model, Version, Serial, PIV status
```

**Provisioning:**
```bash
# After importing secrets with YubiKey configs
# Click "Provision YubiKeys"
# Automatically:
#   - Matches detected hardware with configs by serial
#   - Generates keys in appropriate PIV slots based on role
#   - Root CA → Signature slot (9C)
#   - Backup → Key Management slot (9D)
#   - User → Authentication slot (9A)
#   - Service → Card Authentication slot (9E)
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Prepare your secrets files
cat secrets/secrets.json    # Contains certify_pass (master passphrase)
cat secrets/cowboyai.json   # Contains YubiKey configurations

# 2. Run the GUI
cargo run --bin cim-keys-gui --release -- ./my-keys-output

# 3. Import configuration
#    - Click "Import from Secrets"
#    - All data loads automatically
#    - Master passphrase appears in Organization tab
#    - People appear in organization graph
#    - YubiKey configs appear in Keys tab

# 4. Insert YubiKeys and detect
#    - Keys Tab → "Detect YubiKeys"
#    - Should match your imported configurations by serial

# 5. Generate PKI hierarchy
#    - Generate Root CA (stored on Root CA YubiKey)
#    - Generate Intermediate CAs for departments
#    - Generate Server Certificates

# 6. Provision YubiKeys
#    - Click "Provision YubiKeys"
#    - Keys generated in correct slots with imported PINs

# 7. Export to SD card
#    - Export Tab → Select options
#    - Creates encrypted partition structure
#    - Manifest contains complete audit trail

# 8. Restart the GUI
#    - All data reloads from manifest.json
#    - Organization, locations, people, certificates, keys all restored
```

### Manifest Structure

```
output-directory/
├── manifest.json           # Master index
├── events/                 # Event log (audit trail)

### Graph Interaction

The organizational graph is fully interactive:

- **Drag nodes** - Click and drag to reposition people
- **Zoom** - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **Pan** - Click empty space and drag to pan
- **Auto-layout** - Click "Auto Layout" for automatic positioning

Each node shows:
- Role (above): Root CA, Security Admin, Developer, etc.
- Name (center): Person's full name
- Email (below): Contact email

Edges show relationships with labels:
- "reports to" - Organizational hierarchy
- "delegates to" - Permission delegation
- "trusts" - Trust relationships
