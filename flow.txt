cim-keys has two destinations, a key backup that goes to an SD card and includes our eventstore and artifacts, this is intended for safe storge.
And an encrypted qcow (or other suitable format) that we will transfer to our servers and use as a shared, mounted device that holds our read-only certificates.
Quite literally, cim-keys is the mechanism used to get from a Passphrase to a full PKI with these two projections.
Additionally, these two outputs also have a CID, made from each value it contains, providing both immutability, and identity.
We have several other projections, a certificate is actually a projection because we provide inputs to a function the outputs our projection (a certificate) as files.
we provide a complete audit trail from passphrase to key set.
we also have 2 optional inputs, some.domain.jsonc, which can include the domain but no secrets
And secrets.jsonc which can provide just secrets for known values. both these will need to be heavily adjusted from their current form.
these can also be yaml. another output is a complete graph of ALL the keys and how they are linked as a chain of authority.
